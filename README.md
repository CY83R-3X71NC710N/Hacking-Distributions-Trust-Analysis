# Hacking Linux Distributions Trust Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the trustworthiness of various Hacking Linux distributions. The analysis is based on several factors including security, privacy, and community support. The goal is to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of which Linux distributions are most trustworthy and why.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help users make informed decisions when choosing a Linux distribution. By providing detailed analysis and insights, users can better understand the strengths and weaknesses of different distributions and select the one that best meets their needs.

## Usage

To use this project, simply download the repository and open the PDF files containing the analysis results. The PDFs provide detailed information on each Linux distribution analyzed, including scores and explanations for each factor considered.

## Analysis of Linux Distributions

The analysis covers a wide range of Hacking Linux distributions, evaluating them based on security, privacy, and community support. Each distribution is scored and ranked, with detailed explanations provided for each score. The goal is to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trustworthiness of each distribution.

- Low Trust: Blackarch Linux

# Overall Recommendation:

- My opinion on ParrotOS (I don't like the theme + not as mainstream and industry standard as Kali Linux which matters when getting upper-management let you use the tools)
- Parallels Desktop Windows Base + Coherence Mode + AtlasOS Install + CommandoVM combined with Kali Linux Win-KeX Seamless Mode For Homelabs (Good Balance Windows Tools + Kali Linux Tools) (There are no tools native to macOS for hacking usually, so with this setup you will have almost-all hacking tools in a stable seamless environment)
- Kali Linux for critical production environments. With Kali it is not just the toolset, it is the stable environment that comes with it, often in enterprise environments I find that Windows OS is used as a base, and I dislike windows, so being able to virtualize inside the windows environment and turn it into a GNU/Linux interface makes everything much better.
